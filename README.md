🚧 Limitations
This is a static clone – it does not include real Netflix content, login functionality, or media playback.

For full functionality, you'd need a backend, APIs, and JavaScript for interactivity — but this project focuses purely on layout and styling.

🧠 Future Improvements
✅ Add interactivity using JavaScript

✅ Integrate video carousels and sliders

✅ Implement login validation and storage

✅ Convert to React or Vue for dynamic rendering
